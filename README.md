## 🩺 Heart Rate by Blood Pressure Stage

| Blood Pressure Stage     | Avg Heart Rate (bpm) |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Hypotension              | ~60                  |
| Normal                   | ~70                  |
| Pre-Hypertension         | ~80                  |
| Hypertension             | ~90                  |
| Hypertensive Crisis      | ~100                 |

**Insight:** As blood pressure worsens, heart rate increases — highlighting cardiovascular strain.

## 😴 Sleep Stage Breakdown

| Sleep Stage   | Average Hours |
|---------------|----------------|
| Deep Sleep    | 2.5 hrs        |
| Light Sleep   | 1.0 hrs        |
| REM Sleep     | 1.0 hrs        |
| Wake Time     | 0.5 hrs        |

**Insight:** Deep sleep dominates, aiding physical restoration. Balanced REM/light sleep is essential for cognitive health.
